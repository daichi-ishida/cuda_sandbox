# C++ cross platform template project for VScode
[![CI](https://github.com/daichi-ishida/VSCode-CMakeTemplate/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/daichi-ishida/VSCode-CMakeTemplate/actions/workflows/main.yml)

# Usage
When you create new project, make new directory under the *src* directory and set *TARGET*, which is in CMakeLists.txt under the root dir, to the name of the directory you created.

This template can manage multiple projects, which is great if you want to switch projects by lecture part or by code you want to try!
